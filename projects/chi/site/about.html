    <p class="paragraph">Since the dawn of human civilization, there has been a thirst for knowledge, and the need to pass that knowledge down for generations to come. From that need came the birth of countless writing instruments and mediums, enabling an understanding between the future and the present and the past. But all that has nothing to do with us because we're just a humble pencil vendor. If you're here for motivational speeches, inspirational stories or anything other than mechanical pencils, then prepare to be disapointed. </p>
    
    <h1 class="title-s">Why only pencils?</h1>
    
    <p class="paragraph">*Mechanical pencils. Before <span>chì</span> was founded, we had a brainstorming session where we considered our options, thought about every posibility, and took long looks of ourselves in the mirror. From there we derived a painstakingly intricate and accurate method of determining what the best stationery to sell is. By that we mean a couple google searches, giving up after not getting what we wanted and deciding on a whim that it would be mechanical pencils. Also because <span>mechanical</span> is a dope word.</p>
    
    <h1 class="title-s">Why are there no lead options?</h1>
    
    <p class="paragraph">Because we like intervals of 0.5 and because you don't have a say and/or deserve choices.</p>
    
    <h1 class="title-s">Have you considered other ventures?</h1>
    
    <p class="paragraph">Of course. Rulers go on sale February 31st, 2020. Mark your calendar.</p>
