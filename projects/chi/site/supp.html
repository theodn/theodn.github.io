    <h1 class="title-s">How many leads should I have in my pencil at a time?</h1>
    
    <p class="paragraph">Quite a few models can fit up to 9, but we recommend only keeping 3-4 to avoid jamming the mechanism of the pencil. We all want to be ready but it's better to be safe than sorry.</p>
    
    <h1 class="title-s">I ignored your advice and got my pencil jammed.</h1>
    
    <p class="paragraph">Uh huh. Despite the name and the seemingly complex build, most mechanical pencils are quite easy to disassemble. Take your pencil apart, typically starting by twisting off the end cap, then examine the jammed area. The offending piece of lead can be removed as easily as blowing in air or giving the part a light shake.</p>
    
    <h1 class="title-s">What size lead should I use?</h1>
    
    <p class="paragraph">Despite seemingly making it easy for ourselves, we truly think that <span>0.5mm</span> is the best size for most people. The thickness is a nice balance in terms of stroke size and durability. <span>0.3mm</span> is too thin making it easier to snap. <span>0.7mm</span> is basically indistinguishable from <span>0.5mm</span> unless you set them side by side, and anything after that point is blasphemy.</p>
