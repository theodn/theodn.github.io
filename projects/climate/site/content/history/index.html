                <h2>1. Out of necessity</h2>
                <p>Ironically, climate change heated up the planet and reduced rain, making vegetation harder to find. In order to find enough food, our ancestors had no choice but to eat whatever was available, even if it moves. </p>

                <h2>2. Relative immunity<br>to fats</h2>
                <p>In comparison to other primates, the body of our species has the genes to process high concentrations of fats and proteins. Other apes would see their lifespans reduced by half if they were to adapt the modern human diet. </p>

                <h2>3. The discovery and<br>use of tools</h2>
                <p>The ancient human teeth were stronger and larger, adapted for processing plants. When the earliest tools started being used, our ancestors realized that the same tools can be used to pre-process meat, making it easier to digest. </p>

                <h2>4. More energy is needed for a big brain</h2>
                <p>Having a brain larger than that of other apes of course comes with its perks, but not without its quirks. The modern human brain consumes about 20% of the bodyâ€™s total energy, which meat, being a calorie and protein dense food, can satisfy. </p>
