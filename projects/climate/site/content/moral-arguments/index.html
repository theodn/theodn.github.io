                <h2>We’re risking the fate of billions of humans at the effects of climate change to satisfy our taste buds</h2>
                <p>“Forests and meat animals compete for the same land. The prodigious appetite of the affluent nations for meat means that agribusiness can pay more than those who want to preserve or restore the forest. We are, quite literally, gambling with the future of our planet – for the sake of hamburgers”</p>

            <span class="reveal">
                <h2>The production of meat is so inherently wasteful that if stopped, we can practically end world hunger</h2>
                <p>“By ceasing to rear and kill animals for food, we can make so much extra food available for humans that, properly distributed, it would eliminate starvation and malnutrition from this planet. Animal Liberation is Human Liberation too.”</p>

                <h2>Intelligence isn’t a morally permissible basis to decide what should or shouldn’t be eaten</h2>
                <p>“If possessing a higher degree of intelligence does not entitle one human to use another for his or her own ends, how can it entitle humans to exploit non-humans?”</p>

            <span class="reveal">
                <h2>Animals cannot  articulate and make a case for themselves, thus it’s our responsibiliy</h2>
                <p>“We have to speak up on behalf of those who cannot speak for themselves.”</p>

            <span class="reveal">
                <h2>We should afford animals the shame moral consistency as we do our fellow people</h2>
                <p>“To protest about bullfighting in Spain, the eating of dogs in South Korea, or the slaughter of baby seals in Canada while continuing to eat eggs from hens who have spent their lives crammed into cages, or veal from calves who have been deprived of their mothers, their proper diet, and the freedom to lie down with their legs extended, is like denouncing apartheid in South Africa while asking your neighbors not to sell their houses to blacks.”</p>
