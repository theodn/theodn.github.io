            <p class="transition-fade">If you've grown up eating meat your entire life, then cutting meat out of your diet entirely at once would be very difficult and probably ill-advised. What's more, the net benefit to the environment from a few people going vegan is not enough to make a dent to stop climate change, drastic actions are needed when it comes to the factory farming industry.<br><br>
            However, if you feel some sense of moral obligation, then you can start small. Try having one meat-less day every week, then go up from there. Even though the first paragraph might not sound like it's encouraging individual action, as the age old wisdom goes, every little bit helps. The less meat you purchase and consume, either indirectly from restaurants or straight from supermarkets, the better off the environment will ultimately be.</p>
